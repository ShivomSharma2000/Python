# Video 5 Notes
(1) In python, almost all variables are objects.(like integer object, string object etc.)

(2) In python, when we declare 'string' (immutable), then in memory it will be stored as a 'string object'. Similarly for other 
data types. and it will stored in memory as reference. So, if we declare another string by using same variable, then previous value of
same variable will not changed.they are always in their original state. Then after, 'python garbage collection' comes and delete
the previous value of same variable from memory.

In future, if you want to change string value, like want to change 'chaiaurcode' to 'chaiAurcode'. It is not possible for same reference.
It will also create another reference.

Note:
In immutable object, we can't modify the existing data. But in mutable objects, it's possible to modify the existing data on same refrence.
